            Serving specific pages to particular Telegram users is an extremely powerful tool that allows you to build cool HTML5 games and integrated interfaces. But power of this kind also requires a lot of responsibility on the part of bot developers. Please read our Rules carefully, and accept them only if you agree with them.
